PROJECT TITLE - Project: Create a Token

DESCRIPTION -

This Solidity contract, MyToken, implements a basic token system on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes:

Public variables to store the token's name (tokenName), abbreviation (tokenAbbrv), and total supply (totalSupply). A mapping (balances) to keep track of each address's token balance. A mint function to increase the total supply and the balance of a specified address. A burn function to decrease the total supply and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure the address has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount. This contract enables the creation, distribution, and destruction of tokens while maintaining a record of each address's balance.

GETTING STARTED -

For this we need any IDE that can work with Solidity to create contracts. The IDE used for this project is Remix - Ethereum IDE.

EXECUTING PRORGAM -

To execute this program we firstly need to compile it in this example we have used remix so firstly compile the program then deploy the program from deploy and run the transaction then we can mint and burn and get the desired value for our token and perform all the functions.
